15 Years ago, Rex, the owner of Riverbend Campground brought a vision to a group of Sevierville youth pastors. I want to do something to reach the youth of this generation he said. Later that summer, The Jesus Rally was born. Rex allowed anyone that wants, to come and camp for free so long as they were there for the Rally, and every night, folks would gather for worship. There would be different speakers and musical guest every night as well.  

Truth be told, the Jesus Rally is kinda like a wierd looking kid with a music festival for its momma and an old time tent revival for its daddy. 
 
Over the years, the event has grown in size. With pretty much zero promotion, people from all over started coming to the Rally every year. Groups from as far as Pennsylvania and Florida have started to make The Jesus Rally their yearly summer tradition. Folks come, camp, worship, and hear the Gospel preached. The Jesus Rally has a certain redneck charm and simplicity that you don’t see at most events. These days over 1000 people a night gather to worship.  

This year we are really hoping to open the rally up more to groups around the East Tennessee area to some and join in the fun, whether thats bringing up a van load for one night of the Rally, or making plans to come every night! So if you were waitin for an invitation, that’s it! Ya’ll come! It’s free, and the music and speakers are some of the best in the country.  

And We’d be mighty grateful if you’d help us spread the word about the Rally too. Telling folks, mentioning us on Facebook and Twitter, we’d appreciate all the help we can get!
