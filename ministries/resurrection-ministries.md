The idea for Resurrection was formed in 1985 at Camp Lookout by three youth pastors, Don Thomas, Hugh Kilgore and Steve Blakemore. Their goal was simple. They wanted to facilitate the Christian experience for young people in a new way. Less than a year later, the first Resurrection was held at the Park Vista Hotel in Gatlinburg.  

Rather than reach out to the individual, Resurrection, as it was named, became a collection of youth groups dedicated to worshiping in this different way, reminding young people they are not alone in their walk with Christ, and most importantly changing their lives forever.  
 
##MISSION STATEMENT:
“Resurrection strives to be the premier Christian youth conference that brings youth groups together for awesome fellowship and authentic worship, where the Gospel is proclaimed, and youth have a spiritual renewal and a closer walk with Christ.”
