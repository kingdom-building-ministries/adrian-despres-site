      <p>Jason Roe has dedicated himself to the ministry of spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the ends of the earth. The foundation of Jason's ministry claims Mark 16:15: 'Go into all the world and proclaim the Gospel to the whole creation.'</p>
      
      <p>Jason's ministry started in youth ministry in 1994. As a youth pastor, he received invitations to preach revivals, retreats, and conferences. In 1997, Jason went on staff at Seymour United Methodist Church as their Minister of Youth and Education. As his gifts developed, the congregation at Seymour confirmed his call to Evangelism and opened the door Jason to enter into full time evangelism. He received an Associates of Science degree from Hiwassee College in Madisonville, Tennessee, a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and a Masters of Divinity from Asbury Seminary. Today, Jason is serving as a General Evangelist for the Holston Conference of the Methodist Church.</p>
            
      <p>Jason is blessed with a wonderful Christian wife, Holly, who is a partner in his ministry through her gifts of music. They are parents of two great kids, Madison and Grayson. They are dedicated to the lifelong mission of spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the world.</p>
